# Horiseon - Code Refactor and Accessibility

The client (Horiseon) required their exsisting codebase to be refactored to meet accessibility standards, and to ensure their website is optimized for search engines.


# Actions taken 

Both the HTML and CSS pages had no stucture, didn't follow a semantic order and were difficult to read. I made the following changes.

* Replaced div tags for header, section, article, aside and footer tags, creating a semantic order
* Repaired the search-engine-optimization navigation tab by adding an id selector
* Renamed title element and added favicon
* Moved main image source from CSS to HTML to allow an alt tag
* Increased height of main image to 1000px so it didn't appear squashed
* Added an alt tag to all images
* Tidied up the code so it looks more presentable and is easier to read
* Restructures CSS code to follow the semantic order of the HTML code
* Consoidated all matching class tags in the contents and benefits sections
* Amended CSS elemnt names to match the HTML element tags
* Removed Li styling as it was set to list-style-none, so offered no benefit to the page
* Input a description above each CSS entry, explaining what it's purpose


# Code Style

* HTML 
* CSS
